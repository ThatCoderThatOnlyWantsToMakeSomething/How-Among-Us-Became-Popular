Among Us is a game, usaully from about 4-10 players. Once every game starts, the host can choose whether when to start the game, and
how much impostors there are. The highest amount of impostors are 3, lowest of 1. The impostors try to kill the crew... they kill
until it's impossible for the crew to out-vote them. The impostors name will be red, and if you are a impostor, you can see your name
